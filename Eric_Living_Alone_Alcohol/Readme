Our team decided to research different variables and circumstances that may play a role in a trend that we all agree seems to be happening in America. The dearth of people becoming parents.
I was tasked with researching if there is a correlation between the American birth rate and drinking alcohol; as well as the birth rate and living alone.
What I found was a bit concerning. The birth rate had a negative correlation to both alcohol consumption as well as living alone. What that means is when people tend to drink too much it means they are not readily able to procreate. The same can be said for those people that choose to live alone. 
	My advice is to put the drinks down and find someone to live with.
